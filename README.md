## Project Background <a name="background"></a>
Airbnb is a home-sharing platform that allows home-owners to put their properties online, so that guests can pay to stay. For hosts, pricing a rental property on Airbnb is a challenging task as it is difficult to determine an optimal rental price to maximize profits. For renters, it is also necessary to know if the listing price worth it. A common practice is to search a lot of properties that are similar to the one you are considering to rent or to put online to get an idea about the price. But this requires a lot of work and could be very time consuming. Is there a better/quicker way? YES! There is! With the help of machine learning, nothing is impossible!

## File Description <a name="filedescription"></a>

* SF folder: San Fransico airbnb listing data download from [insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
* Pre_Processing_Exploration.ipynb: data cleaning and exploration. 
* Modeling: machine learning models using cleaned data.

I wrote a [medium post](https://medium.com/@ywzqhy.816/airbnb-listing-price-in-san-francisco-e77338893db7) on this project described how I cleaned data and some interesting findings from business perspectives. I also explained modeling in brief and presented major results. You can also find recommondations for future work there. A long way to go.
